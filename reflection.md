# Week 04 reflection
Last week's assignment was a more simple assignment than the previous weeks in my personal opinion. 
The solution given had ample comments which is something that I tried to improve upon this current week.
My logic solution was close in nature with a couple of slight differences due to style choice maybe.
I honestly do not recall test implementations given for last weeks' assignment so I did not test my code against the normal .java file. 
I did get a head start on last weeks assignment so I was able to complete it more efficiently via my commits.
Overall the previous week went rather smoothly.
