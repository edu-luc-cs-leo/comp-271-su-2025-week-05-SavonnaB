# Savonna B. Midterm reflection
Reflecting on previous weeks assignments, I would say my logic and reasoning have gotten more simple but better.
The first two weeks were a bit rocky as I could not get my code to run in terminal and I felt a bit discouraged.
Over the last couple of weeks I have been successfully able to pass the implementation tests and overall and feel a bit more confident about the content.
The in-code notations do help as far as guidance and review from class examples.
Honestly, some of the way the code concepts are introduced have been a bit of a challenege to grasp but I have improved since weeks 1 and 2.
I have been joining each class on time. I have missed two classes due to external circumstances out of my control.
However, I try to contribute in class discussions as much as possible even through fear of not saying the correct answer.
I have been consistently writing my thoughts through Markdown as I find it easier to submit with the assignment.
I could be better about some last minute work, the only issue is that Wednesdays are currently my only designated free time I have to really focus on the work but I am getting better at looking at the assignment ahead of time for plan execution.
I am currently up to date on all of my assignments for submission.
